//1)	The difference between JRE,JDK,JVM is given below:
//            •	JRE:-  Java Runtime Enviroment(JRE) provides the libraries ,the java virtual Machine and other components to run applets and application written in the java programming language.
//    JRE does not contain tools and utilities such as compilers or debugger’s for developing applets and applications.
//            •	JDK:- Java development kit is a superset of JRE and contains everything that is in the JRE ,pl;us toools such as the compiler and debuggers necessary for developing applets and application.
//            •	JVM:- Java Virtual Machine is a virtual machine taht provides runtime enviroment to execute java byte code (java after compiling convert to class which contain byte code).
//    The JVM does’nt understand java code directly that’s why we need to compile our code .java to obatin .class files that contain bytecode understanding by the jvm.
