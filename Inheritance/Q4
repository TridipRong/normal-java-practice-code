Q4)
Why is multiple inheritance not supported in java at class level ?
=>Suppose there are three class class A,class B and class C. A inherits from B and C ,and
b and c have some common Method so that time jvm is not able to decide which method to consider.
That's the reason that java does not support multiple inheritance.
