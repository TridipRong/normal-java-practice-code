Type of methods: Interface can have only abstract methods. An abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods. From Java 8, it can have default and static methods also.
Final Variables: Variables declared in a Java interface are by default final. An abstract class may contain non-final variables.
Type of variables: Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables. The interface has only static and final variables.
Implementation: Abstract class can provide the implementation of the interface. Interface can’t provide the implementation of an abstract class.
Inheritance vs Abstraction: A Java interface can be implemented using the keyword “implements” and an abstract class can be extended using the keyword “extends”.
Multiple implementations: An interface can extend one or more Java interfaces, an abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.
Accessibility of Data Members: Members of a Java interface are public by default. A Java abstract class can have class members like private, protected, etc.
